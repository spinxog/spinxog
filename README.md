### Directional Bias: Long

> Modeling uncertainty with high conviction.

---

### Current Mode
- Building models that make decisions faster than humans flinch
- Reading between the priors
- Feeding the stochastic beast, one sample at a time

---

### Stack of Choice
- Python / Numpy / Pytorch / Sklearn
- Java & C++ (learning the edges of both)
- Derivatives: autodiff, financial, existential

---

### Still Climbing
- Learning probability like it decides my future
- Building toward stochastic processes, one paper at a time
- Collecting intuition before formalism

### Not Actively Looking — Always Listening
- If it optimizes something interesting, I’m probably interested.

### Latency matters. Noise matters more.
