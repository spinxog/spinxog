### Process: Nonstationary

**Still learning. Still optimizing.**  
*Architecture subject to change.*

---

### Current Mode
- Building models that make decisions faster than humans flinch
- Reading between the priors, Googling the rest
- Sampling curiosity from every distribution I can find

---

### Stack of Choice

### Still Climbing
- Probability theory → becoming fluent 
- Stochastic processes → queued
- Exploring modeling where it matters: risk, inference, edge

---

### ∂connection/∂effort > 0
- Still early. Still learning. Still interested.  
- Ping if you're modeling something weird.

---

### Transmission

- Working mostly offline
- Broadcasting selectively
- DM if you're building weird things with math.
